                            <li><p>My name is Jorrit Overboom, I am 32 years of age and I live in Breda, The Netherlands. For the past 8 years of my life I have been backpacking around the world, taking on a variaty of jobs to finance the journey. Even though traveling around the world is a neverending quest, I am at a point in my life I want to settle down and learn a real trade. Having worked so many different jobs I easily adapt to new situations and learn fast. Even though my original trade started as a salesman, I have now taken interest in programming. Mathematics at school was my favourite subject and I make sudoku's on a daily basis. Coding to me is like puzzling and I enjoy finding a solution to make a code work. Being new in this field I am hoping to land a job that will challenge and teach me new programming languages and give me an insight on how this sector works.</p></li>

I worked in a workshop in Raamsdonkveer for the majority of 2022. I was responsible for resizing existing wheelchairs to fit the size of the client which it was requested for. This involved me knowing a variaty of wheelchairs and their associated parts. Knowing which tools to use and how. Seeming as I was the main mechanic, I had to monitor other freelance mechanics (we were understaffed), do the administration, communicate with the office for missing parts or corrections on the workingform and teach other colleagues parts of my job in case I would get sick.</p></div>

At average I made 60km a day, cycling all around Breda to deliver packages to clients. This could be anything for anyone including law firms, dentists, city councils, pharmacies and people who have ordered products online. The packages would be documents, dental stuff, medicine, clothes, electronics, bike parts, anything small enough to fit the bags or bikes. Initially I did everyone on my own city bike, but eventually the company got electronic cargo bikes, allowing us to be able to carry more than we ever did before.</p></div>
