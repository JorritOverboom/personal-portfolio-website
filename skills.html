                <p>This page displays some examples of what I am capable of with CSS and Javascript. As for HTML the entire website is a display of that. On the <a href="./contact.html">contact</a> page is an HTML form, which is a display of my knowledge of that and a means to contact me in case of interest.</p>
                <p>As for CSS, below are two of examples of some pictures of my travel with description made with <a href="#flexbox">Flexbox</a> and <a href="#grid">Grid</a>.</p>
                <p>Finally for my display of Javascript I have added a <a href="#dice">dice</a>, which can randomly display one of its six sides, to display what I am capable of with Javascript.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="flexbox">
                <h2>CSS Flexbox</h2>
            </div>

            <div id="grid">
                <h2>CSS Grid</h2>
            </div>

            <div id="dice">
                <h2>Javascript random dice generator</h2>
                <p>Given as an assignment by a friend, whom is a software developer himself, I have made a dice capable of randomly displaying one of its six sides upon clicking the 'roll' button. This assignment was meant to practice combining the use of HTML, CSS and Javascript together.</p>
